# Aspect-based sentiment analysis for Indian Bank Reviews

## **Background**

As part of the WQF7007 Natural Language Processing course during my masters, we were tasked with coming upwith an NLP-based project that could generate insights for businesses. As such, this project was chosen due to the relevance in everyday life for the average consumer.

**What is the project brief?**

Everyday, consumers are faced with the choice of which banking provider to go with. With the myriad of options out there, it can be difficult to narrow down a provider, considering most banks offer similar product and features. However, consumers are ultimately influenced by 3 aspects which shape their experience with the provider:
- Account
- App
- Service

As such, this project analyses a dataset of Indian bank reviews and calculates how well these banks do on each of the 3 metrics. The results are then displayed in a [dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arissa.noordina.bahari/viz/WhichIndianbankshouldyouchoose/Dashboard1)
